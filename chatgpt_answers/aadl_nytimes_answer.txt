The software architecture used in this repository is a **Client-Server Architecture**. This is evident from the fact that the browser side (client) is using a JavaScript snippet to redirect the user to access the New York Times through the AADL website (server). The client-side JavaScript code interacts with the server-side code to provide the functionality of accessing the New York Times content through the AADL platform.
