The software architecture used in this repository is as follows:
- Model-Driven Architecture (MDA): The tools are using AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language) for modeling safety-critical systems.
- Component-Based Architecture: The tools provide various components such as Attack Impact meta-model, Attack Tree editor, Bridge from Attack Impact to Attack Tree, etc.
- Client-Server Architecture: The tools are installed on the client machine (laptop) and interact with the OSATE toolset, which can be seen as the server-side component.
- Plugin Architecture: The tools can be installed as plugins in the OSATE toolset.
- Layered Architecture: The tools consist of different layers such as Attack Impact meta-model, Attack Impact graphical editor, Bridge from AADL to Attack Impact, etc.
- Repository-Based Architecture: The README file mentions different projects and repositories related to the AASPE tools, indicating a repository-based architecture approach.
