The software architecture used in this repository is AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language). AADL is a modeling language used for describing the architecture of complex real-time, embedded systems. It allows for the modeling of system components and their interactions, helping to ensure that the system meets its requirements and performance goals. In this case, the AADL architecture design is used for the MeceLearningSystem, an e-learning application for distributing educational materials and courses.
