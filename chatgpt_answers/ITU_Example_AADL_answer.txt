This repository contains an example implementation of a system using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The repository includes models, diagrams, and documentation showcasing the software architecture of the system following AADL guidelines. The software architecture in this repository is based on AADL, a modeling language specifically designed for the analysis, design, and implementation of real-time and embedded systems. The use of AADL in this repository highlights the focus on system architecture, components, connections, and behavior, as well as the consideration of timing and performance aspects in the design of the system.
