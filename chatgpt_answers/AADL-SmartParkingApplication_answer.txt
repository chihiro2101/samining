Based on the description provided in the README file, the software architecture used in this repository is the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) architecture. This includes the use of AADL code for OSATE (Open Source AADL Tool Environment) for designing and developing the smart parking application. The AADL architecture allows for the modeling and analysis of system architecture at different levels of abstraction.
