In the README file content provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific software architectures used in the repository. It is difficult to determine the software architectures without additional information or details from the project documentation or code itself. Software architectures commonly used in real-time systems could include architectures such as Client-Server, Layered, Event-Driven, or Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) specific architectures. Further information or analysis of the project files would be necessary to determine the software architectures used in the "AADL_RASPBERRY" repository.
