The software architecture used in this repository is likely a combination of:

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture: As this is an ASP.NET Core application, it is likely structured using the MVC design pattern where the application's components are divided into models (data), views (UI), and controllers (business logic).

2. Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration architecture: The application integrates with Azure Active Directory for authentication purposes, which involves using AAD's authentication mechanisms and protocols.

3. Forms Authentication architecture: The application utilizes Forms Authentication to manage user authentication and authorization within the ASP.NET Core framework.

Overall, the repository's software architecture appears to be a combination of MVC architecture, AAD integration architecture, and Forms Authentication architecture.
