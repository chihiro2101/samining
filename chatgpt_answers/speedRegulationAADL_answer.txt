The software architecture used in this repository is an analytical architectural-fault-modeling approach, specifically focusing on speed regulation in a self-driving automobile. The architecture is modeled using the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) and includes two implementations (integration.implementation1 and integration.implementation2). The analyses supported by this model include EMV, Latency, Resources and Budgets. The repository also mentions the use of FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and Fault Impact analyses, although the results cannot be duplicated in the current version of OSATE. To conduct analysis, the user can select an implementation and instantiate it to access the various analyses.
