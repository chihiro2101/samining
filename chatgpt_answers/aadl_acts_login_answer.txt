The software architecture used in this repository is a web application framework called Laravel. Laravel is known for its expressive and elegant syntax, providing a set of tools and features for web development. It includes a routing engine, dependency injection container, database ORM, schema migrations, background job processing, and event broadcasting. Laravel follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern, separating the application logic into models, views, and controllers. This allows for a clear separation of concerns and easier maintainability of the codebase.
