The software architecture used in this repository is based on React, specifically created using Create React App. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Create React App provides a pre-configured setup for developing React applications. The architecture follows a component-based approach, where the UI is built using reusable components that manage their own state. The project structure is organized according to React's best practices, with components, containers, and utility functions separated into different folders. The code is structured in a way that promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
