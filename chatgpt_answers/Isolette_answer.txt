The software architecture used in this repository is likely a **client-server architecture**. The Isolette Thermostat software running on the Isolette device acts as the client, continuously monitoring the air temperature to maintain it within the desired range. The Nurse would have a separate client device that receives alerts from the Isolette Thermostat, indicating when the temperature falls outside the desired range. This setup is indicative of a client-server architecture where the Isolette Thermostat and Nurse devices communicate and interact with each other.
