Based on the information given in the README file, it appears that the software architecture used in this repository is AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language). AADL is a modeling language used for describing and analyzing the architecture of real-time, embedded, and safety-critical systems. The use of AADL suggests that the project is focused on designing and analyzing the architecture of software systems with specific considerations for real-time constraints and safety-critical requirements.
