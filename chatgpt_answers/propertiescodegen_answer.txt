In this repository, the software architecture used is likely based on the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) standard, which is used for modeling and analyzing software and systems architectures. The code generation aspect of the repository suggests that a model-driven architecture approach might be utilized, where software code is automatically generated from high-level models defined in AADL property types. The use of property types in AADL also implies a component-based architecture, where system properties are defined and shared across different components.
