The software architectures used in this repository are:
1. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) - The approach for the verification of the AADL description is based on MDE.
2. Source Meta-model for AADL and Target Meta-model for Timed Automata - Two meta-models are defined for the transformation process.
3. Model2Model Transformation - A transformation process that takes an AADL model and produces a corresponding timed automata model.
4. Model2Text Transformation - A transformation process that takes a timed automata model and generates ta-format code accepted by the Uppaal toolbox.
