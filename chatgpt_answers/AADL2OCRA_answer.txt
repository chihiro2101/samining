From the README file content, it can be inferred that the software architecture used in this repository is a plugin-based architecture. The tool is developed as a plugin for the OSATE platform, which allows for extending the functionality of the platform through plugins. The plugin architecture enables the tool to convert AADL models to OCRA input language within the OSATE environment.
