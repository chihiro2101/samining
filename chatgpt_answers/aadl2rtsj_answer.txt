The software architecture used in this repository is likely based on the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) standard for defining software architectures. Additionally, the transformation process mentioned in the README file indicates that the repository may also incorporate the RTSJ (Real-Time Specification for Java) architecture for generating real-time code from the AADL models.
