The software architectures used in this repository include the following:

1. Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF): EMF is used for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model. 

2. Xtext SDK: Xtext is used for developing programming languages and domain-specific languages.

3. OSATE: OSATE (Open Source AADL Tool Environment) is an open-source platform used for analyzing and verifying critical systems.

4. Prism: Prism is a model checker used for formal verification of systems.

5. AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language): AADL is used for modeling and analyzing the architecture of complex real-time systems.

Overall, the repository seems to incorporate a combination of different software architectures such as modeling tools, languages, and verification tools to support the integration property language developed for multiple models.
