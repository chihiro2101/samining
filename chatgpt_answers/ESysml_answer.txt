Based on the content of the README file, it appears that the repository contains a SysML profile for AADL core, behavior annex, and error model annex v2. The software architectures used in this repository would include SysML (Systems Modeling Language) for defining system structures, behavior, and error models. It may also involve AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) for specifying system architecture and behavior. Additionally, the use of profiles suggests a modular and extensible architecture approach for adapting SysML to specific domain requirements.
