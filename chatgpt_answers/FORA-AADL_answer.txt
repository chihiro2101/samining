Based on the README file content, it is not explicitly mentioned what software architectures are used in this repository. The README file mainly focuses on the organization of discussions and task assignments for the FORA AADL model. Additional information about the software architecture would need to be provided in the repository files or by the admins Bahram and the others involved in the project.
