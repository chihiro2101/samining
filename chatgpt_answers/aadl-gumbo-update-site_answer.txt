The software architectures used in this repository include AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) for modeling system architectures, HAMR (Hardware/Software Co-Design from AADL Models) for code generation from AADL models, and the Sireum platform for executing commands to interact with the AADL GUMBO update site. The plugins for AADL transformation, CLI, AWAS (information flow analyzer and visualizer), and HAMR code generation are also mentioned in the README file.
