The software architecture used in this repository is the MDCF (Model-Driven Cost Estimation Framework) Architect. The plugin translates from a selected subset of AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) into code that can run on the MDCF. The plugin is developed by Sam Procter at K-State's SAnToS Lab. The installation process involves using the update site for OSATE2. The project can be built using Maven with Java 8+ and Maven 3.0+, or with Eclipse by following specific steps provided in the README file. The project is licensed under the EPL (Eclipse Public License). Some acknowledgments are made for the icons and CSS used in the project, and the development of the MDCF Architect is supported by US National Science Foundation awards.
