From the README file content, the software architectures used in this repository include:

1. Empty Isolette system type with two implementations
2. Minimally defined Thermostat subsystem added as Isolette subcomponent
3. Minimally defined physical devices added as Isolette subcomponents
4. System & device interfaces defined, but left untyped
5. System & device interfaces typed with modeled data entities
6. Intra-system connections made among subcomponents
7. Use of enumerated & range composite data entities
8. Abstract Air component in role as controlled block of Isolette control loop
9. Software for Thermostat regulating & monitoring control functionality
10. Operator Interface with temperature settings, display & alarm devices
11. Software for regulating & monitoring interface, mode, & failure functionality

These indicate a combination of system design, data modeling, component interaction, user interface design, and software functionality in the repository.
