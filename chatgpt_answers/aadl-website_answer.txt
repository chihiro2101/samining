This repository contains the code for the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The frontend is implemented with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, separating the presentation layer, business logic, and data layer. The backend is implemented using a RESTful architecture, allowing for easy communication between the front and back end. The website follows a client-server architecture, with the client-side code running in the browser and the server-side code running on a Node.js server. Overall, the website architecture is designed for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
