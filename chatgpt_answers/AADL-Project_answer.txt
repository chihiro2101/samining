In this repository, the software architecture used is likely a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This can be inferred from the features listed in the application such as User Databases, User Login & Sign up, Donor Details, Finding blood group easily, Finding Near By Hospitals, and Achievements & Rewards. The separation of concerns implied by these features suggests that the application follows the MVC design pattern to organize the codebase. The use of Firebase Database and Firebase Authentication also indicates a backend-server architecture for handling data storage and user authentication. Additionally, the integration of Google Maps API for location-based services suggests a client-server architecture for retrieving and displaying geographic data.
