The software architectures used in this repository are:

1. **Modeling Tool:** The use of an open-source tool **OSATE 2.2.1** for AADL modeling.
   
2. **Model Translation Tool:** Developed using JAVA, consists of an XMI parser, translator, and NPTA model generator components.

3. **Evaluation Tool:** Utilizes the statistical model checker **UPPAAL-SMC** for quantitative evaluation.

These three components together form the tool-chain for the quantitative evaluation of Uncertain Hybrid AADL designs.
