The software architectures used in this repository are:
1. **Modeling Tool:** The project uses an open-source tool OSATE for the AADL modeling, which supports discrete and continuous behavior modeling through the BLESS plugin.
   
2. **Model Translation Tool:** The model translation tool is developed using Java and consists of three key parts: 
   i) XMI parser
   ii) Translator for one-to-one mapping
   iii) NPTA model generator.
   
3. **Evaluation Tool:** The project uses the statistical model checker UPPAAL-SMC for the quantitative evaluation of the translated NPTA models.
