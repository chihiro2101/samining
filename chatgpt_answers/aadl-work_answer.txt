The project in this repository provides a set of AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) specifications for a system. AADL is a modeling language used for designing embedded computer systems. The repository likely utilizes a layered architecture, as AADL allows for the specification of different system components and their interactions in a hierarchical manner. It may also incorporate a modular architecture, as AADL supports the creation of reusable and interchangeable components. Additional architectures such as client-server or event-driven may be used depending on the specific requirements of the system being modeled using AADL.
