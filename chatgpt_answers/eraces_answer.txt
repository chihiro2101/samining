The software architectures used in this repository are as follows:

1. Behavior Models written with SCADE
2. Architecture Models written with AADL

The tools available in this repository are designed to compute complexity metrics using the above notations. The tools include:
1. scade-metrics: a SCADE plug-in tool
2. aadl-complexity: an OSATE plug-in

These tools are used to analyze complexity in software models and suggest improvements to reduce complexity.
