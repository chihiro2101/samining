The software architectures used in this repository include:

1. **Main Processor handling the entire system** - The main processor architecture is utilized to handle the operation of the entire filling station.

2. **Main Bus connecting all devices to the processor** - The main bus architecture is used to connect all devices to the main processor and facilitate communication between them.

3. **Main Process managing the operation of the entire filling station** - The main process architecture is employed to manage the operation of the bottling station, with all devices connected to this main process.

4. **Threads** including:
    - **Water Analysis Thread** - A thread processing data from the water pipe, filter, and water quality sensor.
    - **Filling Thread** - A thread processing data from the bottling sensor and water analysis thread.
    - **Operator Thread** - Processes input from the operator interface.
    - **Conveyor Belt Thread** - Processes information received from the conveyor belt.
    - **Control Thread** - Receives information from all other threads and makes the final decision on activating the valves and starting the conveyor belt.

These software architectures in the repository help in modeling and simulating the water bottling station system effectively.
