Based on the content of the README file, it appears that the software architecture used in this repository is based on the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). This can be inferred from the title "AuthInAADL" as well as the mention of modeling authorization in AADL. Additionally, the use of OSATE (Open Source AADL Tool Environment) and Resolute for modeling further indicates that the software architecture in this repository is AADL-based. It is likely that the projects mentioned (aadl-book, alisa-examples, osate-examples, AuthInAADL) are all utilizing the AADL modeling language.
