In this repository, the software architecture used is most likely a translation architecture, where the goal is to convert a FACE 3.0 specification to an AADL 2.2 specification. This translation architecture may involve parsing the input FACE 3.0 specification, processing the data, and generating an equivalent AADL 2.2 specification. The architecture may also include modules or components for handling different aspects of the translation process, such as handling different FACE components and mapping them to corresponding AADL components.
