This repository contains a software tool that translates FACE 3.0 models to AADL 2.2 models. 

## Software Architectures Used:
1. **FACE 3.0 Architecture**: This architecture is used to represent and model the functionalities of the FACE 3.0 standard.
2. **AADL 2.2 Architecture**: This architecture is used to represent and model the functionalities of the AADL 2.2 standard.

The tool utilizes these two software architectures to map and translate the data and functionalities between the FACE 3.0 models and the AADL 2.2 models. 

Please refer to the documentation in the repository for more information on how the translation process is carried out.
