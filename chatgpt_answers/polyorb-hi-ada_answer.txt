The software architecture used in this repository is based on a combination of high-integrity middleware constructs provided by PolyORB-HI/Ada and code generation from AADL models by Ocarina. The middleware is implemented in Ada 2012 and is compatible with native and Ravenscar Ada runtimes. It has been tested on Linux, OS X, Windows, and RTEMS. The architecture involves the integration of PolyORB-HI/Ada with code generated from AADL models by Ocarina to create a high-integrity middleware system.
