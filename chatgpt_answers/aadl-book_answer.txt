Based on the README file content, it is not explicitly mentioned which software architectures are used in this repository. However, since the examples are for the AADL book (which stands for Architecture Analysis and Design Language), it is likely that the software architectures used in this repository are based on AADL. AADL is a modeling language used in the analysis, specification, and design of real-time embedded systems. Therefore, the software architectures in this repository are likely to be based on AADL architecture specifications.
