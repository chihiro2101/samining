The README file does not specify any specific software architectures used in this repository. It only mentions the use of AADL for specification, analysis, automated integration, and code generation of real-time performance-critical distributed computer systems. It is unclear if any specific software architectures (e.g., client-server, microservices, etc.) are being used in the Smart Thermostat project described in the repository.
