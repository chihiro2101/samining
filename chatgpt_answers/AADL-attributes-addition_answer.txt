The software architectures used in this repository are:
1. ReliabilityProperties - This function is used to get the Reliability attribute in Java properties.
2. Line2CertainString - This function is used to judge if a line satisfies some rules and returns a certain string.
3. Main function - This function adds special reliability or real-time attributes to the AADL file based on the string returned by Line2CertainString. 

These software architectures involve using functions to handle different aspects of adding reliability and real-time attributes to AADL files.
