The software architecture used in this repository is not explicitly mentioned in the README file. However, based on the nature of the tool and its usage, it is likely that a simple client-server architecture or a client that interacts with an external API (in this case, the HRT audio archive website) is being used. Additionally, since it is a Python script, it may follow a modular or object-oriented architecture within the script itself. Further analysis of the code in the repository would be needed to determine the specific software architectures used.
