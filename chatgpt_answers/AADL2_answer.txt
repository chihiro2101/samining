Based on the README content, the software architecture used in this repository is likely based on Flutter, which follows the reactive programming architecture pattern. The Flutter framework itself encourages the use of a reactive and component-based architecture for building user interfaces. It allows for the separation of UI components into widgets that can update independently in response to changes in the application's state. This approach helps in creating responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
