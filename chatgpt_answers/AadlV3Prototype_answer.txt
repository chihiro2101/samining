The software architecture used in this repository is based on Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers. The prototype utilizes Sirius Integration with Xtext, Sirius Specifier Environment, and Xtext Testing Framework for modeling and testing purposes. The project structure involves importing various projects into Eclipse, utilizing Git for version control, and running the prototype within a new Eclipse application. The architecture also includes example projects that can be imported into the runtime workspace for further testing and development.
