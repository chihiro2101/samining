The software architecture used in this repository is likely the Flutter architecture, which is a reactive, component-based architecture that utilizes widgets to build UI components. Additionally, the repository might also make use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture patterns commonly used in Flutter applications. However, the specific architecture details are not explicitly mentioned in the README file provided.
