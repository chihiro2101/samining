The software architectures used in this repository are likely to be based on the requirements of the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) project submission. This may include architectural patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), or any other architectural pattern chosen by the project group. Additionally, the repository may contain usage of external libraries for project development, which would be outlined in the README file as per the project requirements.
