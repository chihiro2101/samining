In the README file provided, there is a mention of using Container or AADL models. From this information, we can infer that the software architectures used in this repository are likely Container-based architecture and AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) architecture. These architectures are commonly used in software development to organize and structure software systems efficiently.
