The software architectures used in this repository are not explicitly mentioned in the README file. However, based on the nature of the provided information, the code seems to utilize PowerShell scripting language and Microsoft technologies such as Azure Active Directory (AAD). The script appears to interact with AAD sign-in logs to identify Legacy TLS versions being used. The modifications made to the original code involve including Managed Identity's Sign-in Logs and Service Principal Identity Sign-in Logs, indicating a modular approach to adding new functionality. The presence of PowerShell scripting suggests a procedural or scripted software architecture.
