From the content of the README file, the software architectures used in this repository are:

1. AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language): The repository contains a script that maps FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit) to AADL package for integration into larger AADL models to simulate larger systems. AADL is used for modeling and analysis of embedded real-time systems.

2. Client-Server Architecture: The script interacts with other tools or systems, such as Ocarina, for integration and simulation.

Overall, the repository appears to focus on the integration and simulation of systems using AADL architecture and related tools.
