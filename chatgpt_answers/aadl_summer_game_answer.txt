The software architecture used in this repository is based on the Postman tool for API testing. The architecture involves setting up Postman collections with scripts for logging in, retrieving forms, and submitting data. Specifically, the repository uses the Postman Sandbox for writing test scripts and working with data files. It also utilizes variables for storing user credentials and cookies for maintaining session state. The overall architecture focuses on automating the process of batch-submitting library codes for the Ann Arbor District Library Summer Game.
