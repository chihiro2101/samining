The software architectures used in this repository are:
1. Microsoft Azure Active Directory
2. Log Analytics Workspace
3. Azure Monitor Workbooks

The Azure AD Workbook fork for combining interactive and non-interactive logs utilizes these software architectures for monitoring and analyzing legacy authentication sign-ins. The repository includes a modified workbook.json file that is deployed in Azure Monitor Workbooks to visualize and analyze the combined log data from both interactive and non-interactive sign-ins. 

The deployment process involves editing the workbook.json file with the appropriate log analytics workspace information, creating a new workbook in Azure Monitor, selecting the code editor, pasting the contents of the updated workbook.json file, and viewing the template to display the sign-in details. 

This repository serves as a tool for monitoring and analyzing Azure AD legacy authentication sign-ins using the specified software architectures.
