The software architecture used in this repository is likely modular architecture, with a main module for working with Office 365 licenses and potentially submodules for different features such as referencing licenses and service plans by display name. The architecture also seems to support packaging licenses and disabled service plans together, which may involve a combination of modular and layered architecture to manage these functionalities. Additionally, the AzureAD module is utilized to interact with Azure Active Directory, suggesting a client-server architecture as well.
