The software architectures used in this repository are:
1. AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) for developing the model of the self-driving car with dynamics considerations.
2. Simulink for modeling the dynamics of the self-driving car.
3. Ocarina for performing time and safety analysis.
4. Code generation for implementation.
