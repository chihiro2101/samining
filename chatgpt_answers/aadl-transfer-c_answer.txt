Based on the content of the README file, it appears that the software architecture used in this repository is a code generation architecture. The tool parses AADL models and generates corresponding C language code framework. This suggests a Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) or Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach where the AADL models are transformed into C language code using a specific framework or pattern.
