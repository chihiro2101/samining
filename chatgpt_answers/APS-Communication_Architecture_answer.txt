The software architecture used in this repository is the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). It describes a communication architecture for an Autonomous Passenger Ship (APS) using a Top-down Component-based approach. The architecture model includes different high-level components represented in separate AADL packages, with system-level and connection-level properties defined to enhance the model description. The model is designed to provide flexibility in implementation options and to support various use cases. The repository also acknowledges ongoing project work at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) related to the Autoferry project. Contact information for the architect is provided for further inquiries.
