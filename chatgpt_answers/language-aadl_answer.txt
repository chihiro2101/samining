In this repository, the software architecture used is likely based on the Atom editor's package architecture, which allows for extensions to add functionality such as syntax highlighting for specific types of files. The use of Atom's package architecture suggests a modular and extensible design. The original version of the package was derived from a textmate bundle created by Julien Delange, which may also indicate a modular design pattern. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine any specific software architectures used in this repository.
