The software architecture used in this repository is not clearly stated in the README file. The README file primarily provides information about adding syntax highlighting for AADL files in the Atom editor and credits the original version derived from a textmate bundle created by Julien Delange. The software architecture used in the repository would likely be related to Atom editor packages and potentially the AADL language syntax structure. More details about the software architecture would need to be found in the actual codebase, configuration files, or additional documentation within the repository.
