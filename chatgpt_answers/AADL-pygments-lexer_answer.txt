The software architecture used in this repository is not explicitly mentioned in the README file. It appears to be a Pygments lexer for the AADL language, which is a modeling language used in the development of safety-critical software systems. The README file mentions the usage of a setup script (`setup.py`) for installation, indicating that this is a Python-based project. It is likely that this repository follows a modular or plugin-based architecture for integrating the AADL lexer into the Pygments library. The implementation is mentioned to be derived from an existing file (`AADLLexer.py`) written by Sam Procter for the MDCF project, indicating a possible influence of the original architecture used in that project.
