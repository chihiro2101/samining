Based on the content of the README file, the software architecture used in this repository is likely a client-server architecture. The client-side is implemented using JavaScript and the Azure Active Directory Single Sign-On (SSO) solution, while the server-side involves building and using the Azure Active Directory Library for Java to authenticate and authorize users. The client-side code is executed in a local Rhino script using the Java main() program in WaadAuthentication. Therefore, the architecture involves communication between the client-side JavaScript solution and the server-side Java components.
