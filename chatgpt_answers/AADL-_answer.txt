## Bookingo

Bookingo is a game booking application that allows users to easily find and book games available at various locations. This application was developed using the following software architectures:

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC): The application separates the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (business logic) to ensure clean and modular code that is easy to maintain and update.

2. Client-Server: Bookingo uses a client-server architecture where the client (user interface) communicates with the server (backend) to retrieve and store data, handle bookings, and manage user sessions.

3. RESTful API: The backend of Bookingo provides a RESTful API that allows clients to interact with the server using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This architecture ensures scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration with other systems.

4. Microservices: Bookingo is built using a microservices architecture, where different functionalities of the application are divided into separate services that communicate with each other through APIs. This architecture allows for better scalability, fault isolation, and easier deployment of updates.

Overall, Bookingo is designed with modern software architectures to provide a seamless and efficient booking experience for users.
