The software architecture used in this repository is a modular architecture. This can be inferred from the use of functions within the AADLicensingHelper, as indicated in the README file. The repository contains a collection of functions that work together to achieve a specific set of tasks related to the AzureAD Powershell Module 2.0. The functions can be imported and used separately, indicating a modular design where different components (functions) can be combined and re-used.
