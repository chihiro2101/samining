This repository contains a project focused on the analysis and application of Deep Learning to Solar Irradiance data.

Software architectures used in this repository:
- Deep Learning architecture: This project utilizes Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and predict Solar Irradiance data.
- Client-Server architecture: The project may involve a client-server architecture where data is collected from sensors on a client-side and processed and analyzed using Deep Learning models on the server-side.
- Microservices architecture: The project may be structured using a microservices architecture where different components of the Deep Learning application are broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other to perform specific tasks.

These software architectures may be used in combination to create a robust and scalable system for analyzing and applying Deep Learning to Solar Irradiance data in the AADLIS project.
