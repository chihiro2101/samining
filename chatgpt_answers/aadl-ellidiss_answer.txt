The software architecture used in this repository is based on an extension for Visual Studio Code that adds full textual support for SysML v2 files. The extension includes features such as syntax highlighting, outlines, error detection, reference navigation, symbol renaming, and commands for creating Prolog facts from source and splitting files into one file for each package. The architecture likely involves a parser for SysML v2 files, error detection mechanisms, reference resolution across files, symbol navigation, and command execution within Visual Studio Code. Additionally, the architecture may involve components for handling documentation display, error presentation, and symbol renaming.
