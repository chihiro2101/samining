The software architecture used in this repository is a Layered Architecture. The PolyORB-HI/C middleware provides core middleware constructs for various APIs, and must be used in conjunction with code generation from AADL models by Ocarina. The middleware is written in C99 and is compatible with multiple operating systems such as RT-POSIX, RTEMS, FreeRTOS, Windows, Xenomai, and XtratuM. This indicates a layered architecture where the middleware provides a platform-independent abstraction layer for communication between different hardware and software components.
