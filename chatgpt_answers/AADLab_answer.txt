From the README file content provided, there is no explicit mention of software architectures used in the repository. In order to determine the software architectures used in the repository, it would be necessary to further investigate the codebase and documentation within the repository itself. Common software architectures used in repositories include models such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and more. It would be helpful to analyze the codebase and documentation within the repository to identify the specific software architectures utilized.
