The software architectures used in this repository include:
1. Natural Language Processing for converting text into a proper compiler accepted format
2. ANTLR4 for implementing the lexer, parser, and visitor components
3. Java programming language for the implementation
4. Utilization of Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) for system architecture generation
5. Implementation of a compiler for converting parsed text input into corresponding AADL code.
