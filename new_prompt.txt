Context: You are given a README file of a repository containing information about a software project's architecture. Your task is to classify the architecture according to multiple dimensions: domain, implementation domain, and software architecture style.

Prompt:

1. Domain Classification:
- Please classify the domain of the software architecture described in the README file. Is it primarily focused on e-commerce, automotive, avionics, healthcare, finance, or another domain? Provide the domain classification based on the information provided in the README file.

2. Implementation Domain Classification:
- Additionally, please classify the implementation domain of the software architecture. Is it designed for mobile app development, web app development, cloud-based applications, embedded systems, or another implementation domain? Based on the README file, determine the implementation domain of the architecture.

3. Software Architecture Style Classification:
- Finally, classify the software architecture style employed in the project. Is it following a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, a layered architecture, a microservices architecture, a service-oriented architecture (SOA), or another architecture style? Analyze the information provided in the README file to determine the software architecture style utilized in the project.

Please provide your responses to each dimension with as much detail and accuracy as possible based on the contents of the README file.

"Below is the README file of a repository. Is it following a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, a layered architecture, a microservices architecture, a service-oriented architecture (SOA), or another architecture? From the README file content, please indicate the software architectures used in this repository. Skip explanations and use a comma-separated format like this: software architecture, another software architecture, another software architecture, etc. \n" + content
