### UI Prototype

This project also contains a UI Prototype. This prototype was built during the first sprint for the project, in order to gather feedback from project stakeholders on appearance and workflow. The prototype was developed as a React app. The visual design was created to mimic the default Eclipse style.

The prototype can be viewed live on Netlify at: [https://adventium-gumbo-ui-prototype.netlify.app/](https://adventium-gumbo-ui-prototype.netlify.app/)
