# ERACES
The ERACES project is a research project done at the 
Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Insitute (SEI).
The goal is to design methods and tools to reduce 
complexity in software models.

We had a focus on two types of models:
 * Behavior Models written with SCADE
 * Architecture Models written with AADL

We designed tools to compute complexity metrics
using these notations. We released these tools under
an open-source license.

This is the list of tools available:
 * scade-metrics: a SCADE plug-in tool to compute complexity
   metrics in SCADE models. You need SCADE to use it

 * aadl-complexity: an OSATE plug-in that identify potential
   architectural issues and produce a report that suggests
   improvement to remove them. You need OSATE to use it:
