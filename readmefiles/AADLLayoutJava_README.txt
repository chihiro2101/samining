AADLLayoutJava
==================
AADL Graphical editor is built on the AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language). Currently, the project is looking to optimize the generated
layouts from its AADL model files. This is currently being tested in Java before it is being transferred over. My task
with the testing is designing and implementing the algorithms for determining the optimizations. This includes
shape intersections, line intersections, shape padding, and diagram area. All of these algorithms can be
seen in the MonteCarloLayout.java
