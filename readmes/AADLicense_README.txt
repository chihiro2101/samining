# AADLicense

PowerShell module for working with Office 365 licenses.

## Description

This is a module to make it more convenient to work with Office 365 licenses with the AzureAD module by letting the user reference the licenses and service plans by display name instead of by GUID.

There is also support for packaging licenses and disabled service plans and reference them together. This i similar to how you would work with group based licensing in Azure AD.
